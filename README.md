To execute the program run the ‘relevance_analysis.ipynb’, which contains all the Machine Learning models and their results.

‘disaster_data_relevance.csv’ contains the dataset that is used to train and test the models

To create the ‘disaster_data_relevance.csv’ dataset, run ‘data_bot.ipynb’. 

‘Data_bot.ipynb’ extracts all the necessary information from ‘CrisisLexT26’ dataset and creates the custom dataset  ‘disaster_data_relevance.csv’ which is used by ‘relevance_analysis.ipynb’.
